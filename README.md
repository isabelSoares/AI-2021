# AI-2021 - Home Smart Home
This project was developped under the course of **Ambient Intelligence** on the **Master's degree of Computer Science and Engineering** for the year of 2020 / 2021.

Our project focused on developping a system capable of supporting an automated household, their schema, devices and properties, as well as interacting with them. For this purpose, we developped **Home Smart Home**, a prototype dynamic system which allows multiple users of interacting with their houselholds in a convenient and easy way. Besides the commodity of this kind of system our is also able of defining preferences which can then be schedules and of idenitfying routines in users actions.

    - Verify that you have installed **NPM** by running in any terminal ``` npm -v ```

# Start Up
To propperly initialize both the backend and the frontend you are going to need **two** consoles.

### Initialize **Backend**:
1. Open up a new terminal
2. Navigate to the backend directory, for example using ( ``` cd ./backend/ ``` )
3. Install packages by running in the terminal: ``` npm install ``` (it might take a while to install)
4. Start the backend by running in the terminal: ``` npm run start ``` (a message should appear showing the the backend is listening for requests)

### Intialize **Frontend**:
1. Open up a new terminal
2. Navigate on the frontend directory, for example using ( ``` cd ./frontend/ ``` ) 
3. Install packages by running in the terminal: ``` npm install ``` (it might take a while to install)
4. Start the frontend by running in the terminal: ``` npm run dev ``` (a new windows with the working  application should appear after a while)
